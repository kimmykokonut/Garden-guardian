## WIP Garden Guardian
#### An application to track your gardening process and results over time
 _by Kim Robinson_

 Inspired by our unfinished team week project [Garden Tracker](https://github.com/kimmykokonut/GardenTracker/blob/main/GardenAPI.Solution/GardenApi/wwwroot/img/models.png), my goals were to build out the relationships in the database, switch from MySQL to PostgreSQL and switch from Preact to React, using Typescript, while building out the front end.  Hosting is intended to be on Supabase
